    <li><p>Re-engineered critical functionalities into a modern SPA.
    Built with Angular, HTML5, CSS3, Angular Material, Bootstrap; tested
    with Jasmine &amp; Karma.</p></li>
    <li><p>Developed secure, scalable backend services. Built RESTful
    APIs with ASP.NET Core Web API, MVC, C#, using JSON; implemented
    OAuth2, JWT, and RBAC for security.</p></li>
    <li><p>Optimized database performance with SQL Server. Created and
    tuned stored procedures, UDFs, and complex queries for high
    efficiency and reliability.</p></li>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Built the monolith single page application (SPA) for utility
    billing with Angularjs. HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap.</p></li>
    <li><p>Built the backend as RESTful APIs with .NET, Web API, MVC,
    C#, and JSON. Integrated the user experience with backend APIs for
    using Angular's HttpClient. Implemented interceptors for
    authentication tokens and centralized error handling.</p></li>
    <li><p>Designed a nested routing structure for multi-level views.
    Configured routes with lazy loading of feature modules to optimize
    performance and reduce initial load time. Established route guards
    to provide access control to protected routes and
    screens/views.</p></li>
    <li><p>Built the backend as .NET web apis and deployed to Azure App
    services.</p></li>
    <li><p>Implemented asynchronous workflows using async/await
    patterns, improving responsiveness and throughput under high-load
    conditions.</p></li>
    <li><p>Applied response caching to optimize API performance,
    significantly reducing response times and improving end-user
    experience.</p></li>

    data-driven operations.</p></li>
    <li><p>Applied modern architecture paradigms, including Clean
    Architecture and 12-Factor App principles, for scalable and
    maintainable solutions.</p></li>
    <li><p>Strong advocate of reusable and maintainable code, following
    DRY and SOLID principles, with shared business logic encapsulated in
    reusable services and APIs.</p></li>
    <li><p>Employed asynchronous programming techniques using
    async/await to enhance application responsiveness and
    scalability.</p></li>
    <li><p>Utilized various design patterns such as Repository, Unit of
